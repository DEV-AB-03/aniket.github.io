            <p>
                Bored during the Corona Pandemic I decided to dive into the Working of famous AI systems like Alexa and Siri.
                I successfully built a working <span style="color: gold;">Personal AI system</span> and its scripting is done in <span style="color: gold;">Python</span>.<br> It can do many things
                like show the current weather conditions based on your current location,open Spotify to play music,Send Emails
                and also surf the internet when you search for something.<br>It supports <span style="color: gold;">Voice Recognition.</span><br> It is still in development phase
                and I hope to add some new and exciting features in the future.
